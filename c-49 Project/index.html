<P>ORIGAMI CHRISTMAS TREE</P>
<P><i><h3>The evergreen fir tree has traditionally been used to celebrate winter festivals (pagan and Christian) for thousands of years. Pagans used branches of it to decorate their homes during the winter solstice, as it made them think of the spring to come. ... Christians use it as a sign of everlasting life with God.</h3></i></P>

<P>ORIGAMI RABBIT</P>
<P><i><h3>Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and spin around! A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group of rabbits is called a herd. Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet entirely of grasses and other plants.</h3></i></P>
